## Summary

- I wanted to start a project that required me to work with an API. I believed this would allow me to take a step further with learning JS. I had to research how to get an API key from open weather, fetch the key in JS, and extract the json data I wanted to create a weather card.

### What I learned

- Gained a better understanding of how to grab value from input field and append that data to a container using DOM manipulation.
- Learned how to fetch an api key using an async function. I then destructured the json object to extract the values for city, temp, weather description, and the weather icon.
  -This project required me to extensively google around for how to grab the users input and use that input in an API call. I figured out that I could interpolate the api url with the user input and my key.

### TO Do's

- I wasn't able to figure out how to make a separate function for creating a card and then passing my destructured variables to that function.
- Everything is in the renderWeather() function and I know this is not feasible and doesn't practice the principles of DRY. I hope with more practice, I can come back and reformat this code.
